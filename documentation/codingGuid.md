## Notes for Future Use of Pull Requests for an Effective Review Workflow

1. **Target Branch**:  

   Ensure that all pull requests are reviewed by teammates before merging.

2. **Clear Descriptions**:  

   Any pull request **without a clear message**, description, or comments will be added to a **review report** used purely for metrics tracking.

3. **Code Modifications**:  

   If code is modified outside of one's designated responsibility area, **explanation** for the changes must be provided, and a request of changing has to be made to the person responsible of the code section.

4. **Code Format**:  

   All code must follow this structure for consistency and readability:

   ```python

   # This is an example function to demonstrate the structure of code.

   # A function should include a description of its purpose, parameters, and return values.

   def example_function():

     # Additional code should also be commented for clarity

   ```

5. **Code Readability**:  

   Following this format ensures **better readability** and understanding of the code.
