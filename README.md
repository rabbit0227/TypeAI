## TypeAI
#Introduction
The TypeAI project aims to develop a web-based text editing platform that empowers users to
improve their writing through AI-driven corrections, with the Text Correction System as a core
component. This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the software request for the Text
Correction System, which enables users to correct text using the Gemini API and Google AI Studio,
filter blacklisted words, and manage token-based charges, all while logging changes for transparency.
Designed for students, writers, and educators seeking an accessible editing tool, the system will be
developed by a team of software engineering students using Django for a secure back-end and a flexible
front-end chosen by the team. The scope includes AI text correction, blacklist filtering, and file handling
for text, .doc, and .pdf files via a web interface, the project also includes features for exclusive paid users
like user collaboration and specific text statistics. This SRS is essential to the projectâ€™s success, providing
a clear overview to ensure the Text Correction System meets user needs and technical goals.
